# Anish Shenwai - Tower Defense Prototype

Another work in progress - a small scale randomly-generated tower defense prototype I made.

So far features include enemies that are fairly good at pathfinding around structures you construct by using a modified A-Star Algorithm

## Enemies:

These enemies drop coins, which you can collect to spend on building materials

Current defenses include spikes, turrets, and walls
